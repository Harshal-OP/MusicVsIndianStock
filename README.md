Will try to analyze the relationship of Indian Stock Market behavior in respect to the music they listen


We will explore the impact of music sentiment on the stock market, how music influences investor behavior and market sentiment, and the potential implications of these findings for businesses and investors. We will examine the key factors that contribute to this relationship, including  market trends, and the power of music to evoke emotions and drive decision-making using Python and R.
